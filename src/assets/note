Attribute directive 

Change the appearance or behavior of DOM elements and Angular components with ***attribute
It used elementref: Elamantref to access dom elements belonging to the module where it is imported*** 

To use it in the templates. <p directiveName></p>

using renderer is a better way to work with directives which is what I’ll have in git
